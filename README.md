# Audio-Based-Psychological-Analysis-Using-Face-Recognition
Emotion recognition using multiple information channels has recently received significant attention. A widely accepted prediction is that computing will move to the background, weaving itself into the fabric of our everyday living and projecting the human user into the foreground. To realize this goal, next-generation computing will need to develop human-centred user interfaces that respond readily to naturally occurring, multimodal, human communication. Some examples of multimodal emotion recognition application include online learning, Entertainment, biometric systems, human computer interaction, interpersonal relation and behavior prediction. Two natural and effective ways to express emotion in human-human interaction are speech and facial expression. In this work we will try to extract the facial features of a person using a hybrid computer vision and image processing techniques. The trained result thus obtained will be used to provide assistance using a audio feedback
